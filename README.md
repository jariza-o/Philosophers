## Philosphers Problem

The "philosopher's problem" is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, particularly in the context of concurrent programming. It imagines a scenario where a group of philosophers sits around a dining table, with each philosopher thinking and eating. The challenge is to design a system that avoids deadlock and ensures fair sharing of resources (the forks on the table) among philosophers, while preventing conflicts and ensuring that each philosopher can eat without being blocked indefinitely. It highlights the complexities of resource allocation and mutual exclusion in concurrent systems.
